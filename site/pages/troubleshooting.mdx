# Troubleshooting & Logs

**When something breaks, go straight to the right log, grab the error, and decide the next action.**

---

## Cursor IDE

- **Where:** `Cmd/Ctrl + L` → right panel chat history, or `Cmd/Ctrl + \`` for the integrated terminal.
- **Look for:** Last failed command, model response errors, stack traces in the terminal.
- **First fix steps:**
  - Re-run the command with `--verbose` if available (e.g., `npm run dev -- --verbose`).
  - Highlight the error message and ask Cursor: “Explain this stack trace and propose a fix.”
  - If Cursor keeps guessing, paste the relevant file section and restate the requirement plainly.

---

## GitHub (Pull Requests & Actions)

- **Where:** Repo → **Pull Requests** → select PR → **Checks** tab for Actions logs.
- **Look for:** Red ❌ steps, especially `build`, `lint`, or `deploy`.
- **First fix steps:**
  - Click the failing job → **View raw logs** to copy the exact error.
  - If lint/test failure, reproduce locally with the same command shown in the log.
  - For permission or secret issues, confirm the GitHub → Vercel/Supabase integration scopes.
  - Restart only after you understand the failure—otherwise you’ll burn more time waiting.

---

## Vercel Deployments

- **Where:** Vercel dashboard → your project → **Deployments** → select the failing build → **Logs**.
- **Look for:** Build step errors (dependency install, Next.js build) or runtime errors after deploy.
- **First fix steps:**
  - Match the failing step with the corresponding local command (`pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, etc.).
  - Check **Environment Variables** tab—missing env vars are the #1 production issue.
  - If runtime errors appear post-deploy, open the deployment URL with `?vercelToolbarCode=...` for live logs, or run `vercel logs <deployment-url>`.

---

## Supabase

- **Where:** Supabase dashboard → project → **Logs** (top nav) or **Table Editor / SQL** for schema errors.
- **Look for:** API errors (Auth, Functions), Postgres errors, rate limit warnings.
- **First fix steps:**
  - For migration failures, run `supabase db push` locally and watch the terminal output.
  - Database errors often reference a specific table/column—jump to that migration file and verify schema.
  - Auth/function issues: open **Authentication → Providers** or **Edge Functions → Logs** for more context.
  - If you broke local dev, reset with `supabase db reset` (warn team before wiping data).

## When in Doubt

1. Capture the exact error message and where it appeared.
2. Note what changed right before the failure.
3. Share both in Cursor or with your team and propose one next experiment.

Fast feedback beats frantic guessing—let the logs guide the fix.
