# From Idea to App: Building with AI

## Stop Getting Stuck. Start Shipping.

You've played with ChatGPT. You've seen the demos. But when you sit down to build something real, the magic fades. Conversations go in circles. Generated code breaks. Your brilliant idea stays trapped in limbo.

**There's a better way.**

This course teaches you the systematic workflow that transforms AI conversations into production-ready applications. Not tips and tricks that expire with the next tool update‚Äîbut a foundational approach that works regardless of which AI assistant you use.

## What Makes This Different

### üéØ Build Real Things
Not toy examples. You'll create a complete MVP with authentication, database, and deployment‚Äîthe full stack that separates tinkerers from builders.

### üß† Learn the Method, Not the Tool
AI tools change every month. The principles of structured planning, precise prompting, and intelligent iteration? Those are timeless. We teach you the thinking that transfers.

### ‚ö° From Zero to Deploy
Start with nothing but an idea. End with a working application on the internet. Follow the complete journey, including the messy parts nobody shows you.

### üõ†Ô∏è Real Development Tools
No vendor lock-in. Learn with Cursor, Supabase, GitHub, and Vercel‚Äîthe same professional stack used by modern startups. Everything has generous free tiers.

## Who This Is For

Whether you're a **developer** who wants to 10x your velocity, a **product person** tired of waiting on engineers, or an **entrepreneur** who needs to validate ideas fast‚Äîif you can follow instructions and think systematically, you can do this.

The only prerequisite? A willingness to learn and iterate. We'll teach you everything else.
