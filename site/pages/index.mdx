title: From Idea to App - Building with AI
description: Turn your ideas into working applications using AI-powered development tools

# Building with AI Course

The playbook for shipping real software with AI copilots. Work through each module to plan, build, and deploy an MVP using Cursor, Supabase, GitHub, and Vercel.

## What you’ll build

- A concrete problem statement and user journey grounded in the Planning Worksheet  
- A Supabase-backed app scaffolded and iterated with Cursor  
- A production deployment on Vercel, with optional self-hosting on AWS  
- A troubleshooting habit that leans on the right logs instead of guesswork

## How to use this course

1. Read the [Introduction](/introduction) to align on the workflow and expectations.  
2. Complete the core modules in order while following along during the live sessions.  
3. Use the advanced modules when you want deeper CLI control or alternative deployment targets.  
4. Keep the [Troubleshooting & Logs](/troubleshooting) page open whenever something fails.
