# Introduction

**Master the art of building software with AI—not just for today's tools, but for tomorrow's.**

This course teaches you the **engineering mindset and systematic workflow** that will keep you productive no matter how the toolset changes. You'll learn to think like a systems architect while moving at startup speed—planning deliberately, prompting precisely, and iterating intelligently.

## What You'll Learn

- **Strategic Planning:** How to translate problems into structured requirements that AI can execute
- **Prompt Engineering for Developers:** Crafting system-level prompts that generate production-ready schemas and UI flows
- **The Vibe Coding Workflow:** A repeatable process from concept to deployment
- **Integration Mastery:** Connecting Supabase, GitHub, and frontend builders into a coherent development stack
- **Intelligent Iteration:** Using AI-powered IDEs to refine and enhance generated code
- **Tool-Agnostic Thinking:** Building mental models that transfer across platforms as AI tooling evolves

## Course Structure

Follow along with the worksheets and guides to build your own MVP from scratch:
