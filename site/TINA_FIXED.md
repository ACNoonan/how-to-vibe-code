# TinaCMS Setup - Fixed! ✅

## What Was Wrong

You had **TWO conflicting TinaCMS configurations**:
1. `/tina/config.ts` - The correct config with collection named "page"
2. `/.tina/config.ts` - Old config with collection named "course" and wrong env vars

This caused TinaCMS to not recognize your content files.

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Removed the conflicting `.tina` directory
2. ✅ Fixed environment variable from `TRUE` to `true` 
3. ✅ Rebuilt the TinaCMS schema with the correct config
4. ✅ Removed broken visual editing components incompatible with Nextra

## How to Use TinaCMS Now

### Local Development

```bash
cd /Users/adamnoonan/Documents/how-to-vibe-code/site
pnpm run dev
```

Then navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/admin**

### What You'll See

1. **TinaCMS Admin Interface** - A full-featured CMS
2. **Collections Panel** - Click "Course Pages" to see all your MDX files
3. **File List** - You'll see:
   - `index.mdx`
   - `introduction.mdx`
   - `dev-environment-setup.mdx`
   - `planning-worksheet.mdx`
   - etc.

### How to Edit Content

1. Click on any page from the list (e.g., "index.mdx")
2. Edit the fields:
   - **Title** - The page title
   - **Description** - Meta description
   - **Body** - Rich text editor with full markdown support
3. Click **Save** - This commits changes to your git repository

## Important Notes

### Why No "Visual Editing"?

**Nextra is not fully compatible with TinaCMS visual editing.** Here's why:

- **Nextra**: Compiles MDX files statically at build time
- **TinaCMS Visual Editing**: Requires dynamic data fetching with `useTina` hook

However, the **Admin Interface** works perfectly and gives you:
- ✅ Full editing capabilities  
- ✅ Content preview
- ✅ Rich text editing
- ✅ Direct git commits

### For Production (GitHub Pages)

When deployed, editors can:
1. Visit `https://your-site.github.io/how-to-vibe-code/admin`
2. Sign in with GitHub (via TinaCloud)
3. Edit content
4. Changes create PRs or direct commits (based on permissions)

## Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` is correctly configured:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=fb2ae322-6981-4c14-8d69-0de9917c5204
TINA_TOKEN=a26a176f776a5ae5525648c969fc9c0420e721b0
TINA_PUBLIC_IS_LOCAL=true
```

## Troubleshooting

### If admin shows "nothing to edit":
1. Make sure `pnpm run dev` is running (not just `next dev`)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Navigate directly to a page: `/admin#/~/collections/page/index.mdx`

### If you see connection errors:
1. Stop any running servers
2. Run `pnpm run dev` again
3. Wait for both Next.js and TinaCMS servers to start

## Next Steps

1. Run `pnpm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:3000/admin
3. Click "Course Pages" collection
4. Select a page and try editing!
