# Self-Hosting 101 (Advanced Setup)

**Own the infrastructure when you graduate from Vercel’s free tier.** Follow the checklist to spin up an EC2 box, deploy manually with `pnpm`, and keep it running.

---

## Quick Checklist

1. Confirm GitHub, Git, Node.js, Supabase access from [Dev Environment Setup](/dev-environment-setup).
2. Install `pnpm` and prove the app builds locally.
3. Create an AWS account and launch a Ubuntu EC2 instance.
4. SSH in, install Node.js + pnpm, clone your repo.
5. `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm start` on the server.
6. Add PM2 (optional) and wire up a custom domain if needed.

---

## 1. Local Pre-Flight

- Install pnpm once: `npm install -g pnpm` → verify with `pnpm --version`.
- From your project root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start   # visit http://localhost:3000
```

- Commit and push the working state to GitHub so the server can pull it.

---

## 2. AWS Account & Instance

1. Sign in at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com) → choose the Free Tier.
2. Search for **EC2** → **Launch instance** with:
   - Name `nextjs-server`
   - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
   - `t2.micro` (Free Tier)
   - New key pair (`.pem` download)
   - Allow HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)
3. Wait for the instance to boot, copy the **Public IPv4 DNS**.

**SSH in:**

```bash
chmod 400 your-key.pem
ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

---

## 3. Prepare the Server

Run these commands on the EC2 shell:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo npm install -g pnpm
node --version && pnpm --version
```

Store environment variables (Supabase keys, etc.) in a `.env` file or the shell profile; keep secrets out of git.

---

## 4. Deploy from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
cp .env.production .env   # if you keep a template
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Visit `http://<your-public-dns>` in the browser—your Next.js app should load. Use `Ctrl + C` to stop the process.

---

## 5. Keep It Running (PM2)

```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
pm2 start "pnpm start" --name "nextjs-app"
pm2 save
pm2 startup   # follow the printed instructions once
```

Useful checks:

- `pm2 status` — ensure the process is online
- `pm2 logs nextjs-app` — view runtime logs
- `sudo reboot` → `pm2 resurrect` (if needed after reboot)

---

## 6. Optional: Custom Domain

1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, etc.).
2. In AWS Route 53 → Hosted Zone → create an **A record** pointing to the EC2 public IP.
3. Update nameservers with your registrar to the ones Route 53 provides.
4. Consider adding Nginx + SSL (Let’s Encrypt) once traffic increases.

---

## Validation Loop

| Stage | Command | What to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | `pnpm dev` | UI works while coding |
| Local production | `pnpm build && pnpm start` | Bundled app renders |
| Remote build | `pnpm install && pnpm build` | Dependencies available |
| Remote runtime | `pm2 status` | App stays online after deploy |

Log any failures in [Troubleshooting & Logs](/troubleshooting) with the command you ran and the error snippet.

---

## Practice Challenge

1. Create a test Next.js app with `pnpm create next-app`.
2. Push it to GitHub and deploy to EC2 using the flow above.
3. Add a `/status` route that prints environment info.
4. Confirm you can reach `/status` from the public URL.

You now control the full stack—from prompts to production hardware.
