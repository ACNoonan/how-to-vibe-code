# Planning & Development Worksheet

A structured worksheet to help you move from idea to implementation with AI assistance.

---

# Quick Flow

1. Capture the persona, problem, and desired outcome.
2. Map the 5–8 step user journey.
3. List the data entities pulled from that journey.
4. Use the prompts below (Cursor-ready) to generate schema, API, and UI.
5. Log findings, blockers, and next steps for the retrospective.

# Planning

## Step 1: Problem & Persona

### Who has the problem?

Be specific about the person, not just "users"

**Your Answer:**

```text
(Describe the specific person here)
```

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```text
Busy real estate investors who review 50+ properties per week
```

</details>

### What's the problem?

One sentence. What pain are they experiencing?

**Your Answer:**

```text
(Sum up the pain in one sentence)
```

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```text
They waste hours reviewing listings that don't meet their criteria
```

</details>

### What's the desired outcome?

What does success look like for them?

**Your Answer:**

```text
(Describe the successful outcome)
```

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```text
Quickly identify the 3-5 properties worth scheduling a viewing
```

</details>

---

## Step 2: MVP user journey

### MVP user journey (the UX flow)

Write 5-8 steps describing exactly what happens. Focus on the WHAT, not the HOW.

**Your Journey:**

```text
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
```

<details>
<summary>Example journey (Team Lunch Coordinator)</summary>

```text
1. Person creates an event: "Friday Team Lunch"
2. They set the date and invite teammates via email
3. Teammates receive link and mark dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, allergies)
4. Organizer sees a dashboard of all responses
5. AI suggests 3 restaurants that accommodate everyone's needs
6. Organizer picks one and clicks "Finalize"
7. Everyone gets notification with restaurant details and time
```

</details>

---

## Step 3: Data requirements

### Data requirements

For each entity, list: **Entity Name | Key Attributes | Relationships**

**Instructions:** Look at your user journey and extract the NOUNS (Person, Place, Thing). These become your data entities.

**Your Data Requirements:**

```text
ENTITY:
Attributes:
Why needed: (journey step #)
Relationships:

ENTITY:
Attributes:
Why needed: (journey step #)
Relationships:
```

<details>
<summary>Example (Team Lunch Coordinator)</summary>

```text
ENTITY: events
Attributes: id (uuid), organizer_name, organizer_email, event_name, event_date,
event_time, location, status (planning/finalized/cancelled),
selected_restaurant_id (fk, nullable), created_at, updated_at
Why needed: Core event information created by organizer (step 1)
Relationships: Has many invitations, has many restaurant_suggestions

ENTITY: invitations
Attributes: id (uuid), event_id (fk), invitee_email, invitee_name,
response_status (pending/accepted/declined), responded_at, created_at, updated_at
Why needed: Track who's invited and their RSVP status (steps 2, 3)
Relationships: Belongs to event, has one dietary_preference

ENTITY: dietary_preferences
Attributes: id (uuid), invitation_id (fk), is_vegetarian (boolean), is_vegan (boolean),
is_gluten_free (boolean), allergies (text, nullable), other_notes (text, nullable),
created_at, updated_at
Why needed: Store each attendee's dietary restrictions (step 2)
Relationships: Belongs to invitation

ENTITY: restaurant_suggestions
Attributes: id (uuid), event_id (fk), restaurant_name, cuisine_type, address,
price_range, phone, meets_all_restrictions (boolean), accommodates_notes (text),
menu_url (nullable), suggested_at, created_at
Why needed: Store AI-generated restaurant options (step 5)
Relationships: Belongs to event
```

</details>

# Development

## Step 1: Database Schema Generation

### 🎯 Purpose

Generate complete SQL schema for Supabase that you can copy/paste into the SQL Editor.

### 📋 Prompt template

Copy this template and fill in YOUR information from Planning Steps 1-3:

```text
You are a senior database architect specializing in PostgreSQL and Supabase.

CONTEXT:
I'm building an MVP for: [PASTE YOUR PROBLEM STATEMENT FROM STEP 1]

The core user journey is:
[PASTE YOUR MVP USER JOURNEY FROM STEP 2]

DATA REQUIREMENTS:
[PASTE YOUR DATA REQUIREMENTS FROM STEP 3]

TASK:
Generate a complete SQL schema for Supabase (PostgreSQL) that:

1. Creates all necessary tables with appropriate data types
2. Includes primary keys (UUID preferred for main entities)
3. Includes foreign keys with proper constraints:
   - Use ON DELETE CASCADE where child records should be deleted with parent
   - Use ON DELETE SET NULL where we just want to unset the reference
4. Includes indexes on columns that will be frequently queried or filtered
5. Includes created_at and updated_at timestamps (with automatic triggers for updated_at)
6. Uses Row Level Security (RLS) appropriate for an MVP (enable RLS but leave policies for later)
7. Follows PostgreSQL and Supabase best practices

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
[List any specific data types, constraints, or relationships you want]
Example:
- Use DATE for event_date, TIME for event_time
- Use VARCHAR(255) for names and emails
- Add CHECK constraints for status fields
- Expected load: <100 records per month

CONSTRAINTS:
- This is a free tier Supabase project (keep schema efficient)
- [Add any other constraints about authentication, user load, etc.]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a single, complete SQL script that I can copy and paste into the Supabase SQL Editor.
Include comments explaining each table's purpose.
Include the updated_at trigger function and triggers for all tables.
```

## Step 2: User Interface Generation

### 🎯 Purpose

Generate a complete Next.js application using V0 or Cursor that implements your user journey.

### 📋 Prompt template

Copy this template and fill in YOUR information:

```text
You are an expert frontend engineer specializing in Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

CONTEXT:
I'm building an MVP for: [PASTE YOUR PROBLEM STATEMENT]

The target user is: [PASTE WHO HAS THE PROBLEM]

MVP USER JOURNEY:
[PASTE YOUR USER JOURNEY]

DATA AVAILABLE:
I have a Supabase PostgreSQL database with the following tables:
[List your table names and key columns—don't paste entire SQL, just structure]

Example format:
- events (id, organizer_name, organizer_email, event_name, event_date, status)
- invitations (id, event_id, invitee_email, response_status)
- dietary_preferences (id, invitation_id, is_vegetarian, is_vegan, allergies)

TASK:
Generate a complete Next.js application that implements the above user journey.

REQUIREMENTS:

UI/UX:
- Modern, clean design using Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation
- Loading states for data fetching
- Error states with helpful messages
- [Add design preference: "Minimalist" / "Playful and colorful" / "Professional SaaS"]

Technical:
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase client for database queries
- Server components where appropriate, client components for interactivity
- Form validation where needed
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

Pages/Components Needed:
[Based on your user journey, list main pages]

Example:
1. Landing/Event Creation page (step 1)
2. Invitation Response page (steps 2-3)
3. Organizer Dashboard (step 4)
4. Restaurant Selection page (step 5)
5. Confirmation page (steps 6-7)

Key Features:
[Translate each journey step into feature requirements]

Example:
- Event creation form with date/time pickers and email input
- RSVP form with dietary restriction checkboxes
- Real-time dashboard showing all responses
- Restaurant card display with selection buttons
- Email notification triggers (can be placeholder for MVP)

STYLING PREFERENCES:
- Color scheme: [e.g., "Professional blues and grays" / "Warm earth tones"]
- Typography: [e.g., "Clean sans-serif, high readability"]
- Overall feel: [e.g., "Polished SaaS tool" / "Fun consumer app"]

CONSTRAINTS:
- This is an MVP—prioritize core functionality over polish
- Free tier Supabase (optimize queries)
- [Add any other constraints: "No authentication yet" / "Mobile-only" / etc.]

OUTPUT:
Generate the complete application code, including:
- All page components
- Reusable UI components
- Supabase client setup
- TypeScript types based on database schema
- Basic error handling

The code should be immediately deployable to Vercel and connectable to my Supabase project.
```

## Step 3: Connecting Your Application

### After generating code, you need to connect it to your Supabase database:

**In Supabase:**

1. Go to Project Settings → API
2. Copy your Project URL
3. Copy your `anon/public` API key

**In your code:**

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Add these lines:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

**Deploy to Vercel:**

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

## 🎯 Quick Reference: When to Move Fast vs Slow

### MOVE FAST ⚡

- Tweaking UI colors, spacing, layouts
- Implementing features you've done before
- Trying different approaches to the same problem
- Deploying changes to test

### MOVE SLOW 🐢

- Planning your data model
- Adding new features you haven't built before
- Debugging persistent errors
- Setting up authentication or payment systems
- Performance optimization

**Remember:** Things will break MORE than they work. That's normal. Flow comes from knowing when to trust the AI and when to slow down and think.

## Next Steps: Beyond MVP

Once your MVP is working, consider:

1. **Add Authentication** - Convert emails to user accounts
2. **Improve AI Features** - Replace placeholders with real AI
3. **Add Payment Processing** - If needed for your model
4. **Performance Optimization** - Database indexes, caching
5. **Error Handling** - Better user feedback
6. **Testing** - Automated tests for core flows
7. **Analytics** - Track how people use your app

---

**Remember the Flow State Formula:**

1. ✅ Clear Goals (your user journey)
2. ⚡ Fast Feedback (deploy early, test often)
3. 🎯 Challenge vs Skill (start simple, build complexity)
4. 🧘 Action = Awareness (stay present with the code)
5. 🎉 Intrinsically Rewarding (celebrate small wins!)

Good luck on your build! 🚀
