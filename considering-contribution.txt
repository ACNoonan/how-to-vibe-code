The Critical Step: Incorporating Contributions
There is one important manual step to keep in mind with this workflow. When a student submits a pull request and you merge it:
The change is made to the Markdown file in GitHub.
That change will immediately be visible to students on the public Notion page (because it's just displaying the GitHub file).
However, your original private Notion page is now out of sync. You will need to manually copy the student's changes from GitHub back into your private Notion page.
If you forget this manual copy step, the next time the automated sync runs, it will overwrite the student's contribution in GitHub with the older content from your private Notion page.
This isn't necessarily a bad thingâ€”it just makes your private Notion the ultimate authority and forces a deliberate review process for incorporating changes.
